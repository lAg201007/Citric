# Project diary

- The destination was made as a local clone of Rosemary source at base commit
  c14275b, then the complete working diff was applied. CaseSolved content was
  deliberately excluded.
- The Studio app, ready binary, and Darwin cache were copied for continuity but
  kept out of Git to avoid publishing proprietary or account-related data.
- X11/XWayland became the launcher default after Wayland reproduced the plugin
  loading window. This is a runtime workaround, not proof of a full modal
  lifecycle fix.
- The View Selector was repaired rather than disabled: an invisible overlay had
  consumed a broad top viewport strip. The user later confirmed Edit and Play
  clicks worked.
- Docking was left pending after repeated crashes and unreliable guides because
  the user prioritized general stability.
- Camera scaling was reduced repeatedly, ultimately to 0.003 for captured/right
  drag input, but manual validation still found excessive speed and abrupt
  rotations. This remains an investigation item.

Reusable lesson: keep raw account-bearing logs outside the repository and use
the normal launcher for crash reproduction; direct GDB startup produced a
different early selector failure.
