# Project overview

Citric is the local continuation of the Rosemary compatibility work for running
the macOS Roblox Studio client on Linux. Its current branch stores the
compatibility patches, launcher, scripts, and diagnostic record; Rosemary source
is materialized only in a temporary build checkout.

The GitHub repository is a standalone Citric repository. Locally, `origin`
points to Citric and `upstream` points to Rosemary, so updates can be fetched
without pretending that GitHub has a formal fork relationship. The proprietary
Studio bundle, runtime binary, and Darwin cache are physically available but
ignored by Git; their versions and hashes are documented in docs/bundle.md.
The authenticated user prefix and raw logs remain outside this repository.

The repository contains a GTK 4 launcher in `citric_launcher/` and a canonical
runtime patch series in `patches/`. `scripts/build-studio.sh` fetches the pinned
Rosemary commit, applies `patches/series`, builds in a temporary cache, and can
install the resulting ignored `bin/rosemary` executable. Earlier Git commits
retain the removed Rosemary source, so history and reproducibility are kept.

The patch-overlay migration is complete. Future work resumes from
docs/current-state.md and should preserve the separation between source changes,
local runtime assets, and user account state.
